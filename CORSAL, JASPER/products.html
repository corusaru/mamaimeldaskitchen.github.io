                    <p>We've elevated the classic Filipino street food <em>tokneneng</em> into a signature delicacy.

Each egg is fried to golden perfection, offering a crispy exterior that contrasts beautifully with the soft, tender center. Our secret? A vibrant orange batter that not only adds color but layers of flavor. Paired with our house-made vinegar dipping sauce, enriched with garlic and chili, this creation is a small but unforgettable taste of tradition, reimagined for the modern palate.</p>
